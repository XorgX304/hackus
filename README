This repository contains the contest code/script/configurations I did for the
Hackus competition.

You will only find *past* Hackus source code so don't bother looking for the
upcoming Hackus ;).

Please have a look at http://www.hackus.org for more details of what the Hackus
is actually is.

Cheers!
David
